********************************************
JavaScript Where To
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
  <script language = "javascript" type="text/javascript">       
       document.write("Hello World!")
console.log('Hello")

External JavaScript
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.

You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

***************************************************
Why use External JavaScript
As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.

The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.

Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.

That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.
